# DSL501_Project

Course Project for DSL501 Machine Learning.
Conditioning LLMs with Emotion in Neural Machine Translation

## Dataset

This project uses the **Libri-trans** dataset (Kocabiyikoglu et al., 2018).

- **Source**: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6482585#.YsmVBUhBxkg)
- **Size**: ~235 hours of speech (~500k ENâ€“FR pairs)

**Note**: The full dataset is very large (tens of GB) and is therefore **not included in this repository**.  
Instead:  
- You can download the complete dataset directly from Zenodo using the link above.  
- For demonstration and reproducibility, this repository includes scripts to create a **small subset** of the data.
